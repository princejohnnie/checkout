## A simple credit card validation app

### This project is designed to reduce the strain on an external payment system by takeing in a user's credit card information and validates it before sending it to any Payment API for processing.
It is divided into two parts: Frontend and Backend. The Frontend takes in the credit card information and displays an error for incorrect entries. The Backend does the validation and returns reponse to the Frontend.

The Backend is built using Java's Springboot Backend Framework while the Frontend uses HTML, CSS and Javascript for styling and making API requests.
